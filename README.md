## Future Improvements

The Note Taking App is still under development, and there are plans for future improvements. Some of the potential enhancements include:

- Refactoring the app using React's component-based architecture for better organization and reusability of code. (Please note that the React version's code is located in the "react-version" folder, specifically in the file named "react.js".)
- Introducing drag-and-drop functionality for easy reordering of notes.
- Enhancing the user interface with more intuitive interactions and visual feedback.

We welcome contributions and suggestions for these or other improvements. If you have any ideas, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
